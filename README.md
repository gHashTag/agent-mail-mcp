# agent-mail-mcp

Read-only Zoho Mail access for AI agents, as an **MCP server** and as a **CLI**. No
browser, no webmail tab, no IMAP, no password anywhere in the loop.

Python standard library only — no `pip install`, no virtualenv, no lockfile. An agent
tool that needs a package install is an agent tool that breaks on a fresh machine.

## Why it is built this way

**Read-only by construction, not by instruction.** The OAuth client is minted with
three read scopes and nothing else. An agent holding these tools *cannot* send, reply,
move, mark or delete — the provider refuses the call. It is not asked to behave; it is
unable to misbehave. That is the only version of "read-only" worth relying on when an
agent runs unattended.

**Secrets never reach an agent's context.** `bootstrap.sh` reads them with `read -s`
and writes them straight into the OS keyring. They never touch a file in this repo,
your shell history, or a model's context window. `whoami` reports token *state* and
never token *value*.

**One implementation, two front doors.** The MCP server shells out to the same CLI you
run by hand. Two code paths to one mailbox drift, and the one the agent uses is the one
nobody tests.

**Failures are loud.** A failed call exits non-zero with the real reason. It never
returns an empty list — "no mail" and "not authenticated" must not look alike, because
an agent that confuses them stops silently and reports success.

# Setting up on a new computer

Roughly ten minutes. Steps 2–4 happen in a browser on the Zoho API console; everything
else is terminal.

## 0. Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| OS | macOS, Linux, or a container |
| Python | 3.9+ (`python3 --version`) — no packages needed |
| Secret storage | macOS Keychain (built in) · Linux `secret-tool` · or environment variables |
| Account | any Zoho Mail account, **including Free** — see [Plan gating](#plan-gating) |

On Debian/Ubuntu, if you want the keyring rather than env vars:

```bash
sudo apt install libsecret-tools
```

## 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gHashTag/agent-mail-mcp.git ~/agent-mail-mcp
cd ~/agent-mail-mcp
chmod +x zmail.py mcp_server.py bootstrap.sh
```

## 2. Create a Self Client

Go to **[api-console.zoho.com](https://api-console.zoho.com/)** → **ADD CLIENT** →
**Self Client** → **CREATE NOW** → **OK**.

Zoho will demand identity re-verification before it lets you into this console
(password, or federated sign-in if your account uses SSO). That is deliberate and it
is a good thing: minting API credentials should never be delegable to an agent.

You land on a page with two tabs, **Generate Code** and **Client Secret**. Leave it
open — you need both.

> **Already have a Self Client from another machine?** Reuse it. Open the existing
> client instead of creating a second one, and skip to step 3. One client can issue
> many codes.

## 3. Generate a code with read-only scope

On the **Generate Code** tab:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | `ZohoMail.accounts.READ,ZohoMail.folders.READ,ZohoMail.messages.READ` |
| **Code expiry duration** | `10 minutes` |
| **Description** | `Read only mailbox access for local agents` |

Paste the scope exactly — no spaces after the commas. Then **CREATE**, choose your
portal if asked, and copy the generated code.

Two things that will waste your time otherwise:

- The **description field rejects punctuation**. Parentheses and hyphens produce
  "Enter a valid description" with no hint as to why. Keep it to letters and spaces.
- The code is **single-use and expires in 10 minutes**. Run step 4 immediately. If it
  expires, just generate another — nothing is lost and there is no penalty.

## 4. Exchange the code and store the credentials

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

It asks for three things — Client ID, Client Secret (both on the **Client Secret**
tab), and the code from step 3 — exchanges them for a long-lived refresh token, and
writes all three into your OS keyring. The secret and the code are read with
`read -s`: nothing is echoed to the terminal and nothing lands in shell history.

Different Zoho region? Prefix it:

```bash
ZOHO_REGION=eu ./bootstrap.sh
```

## 5. Verify

```bash
./zmail.py whoami
```

Expect your region, the mailbox address and its account id. If you get JSON with an
`address` in it, you are done — everything below is optional convenience.

## 6. Put `zmail` on your PATH

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf ~/agent-mail-mcp/zmail.py ~/.local/bin/zmail
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH` (add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` if not). The script resolves its own real path, so the
symlink is safe.

## 7. Register the MCP server

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user agent-mail -- ~/agent-mail-mcp/mcp_server.py
```

Confirm it came up:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You want `agent-mail: ... - ✓ Connected`.

**Claude Desktop / any other MCP client** — add to the client's config, using an
absolute path (`~` is not expanded by most clients):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/agent-mail-mcp/mcp_server.py"
    }
  }
}
```

If your client will not execute the file directly, call the interpreter explicitly:

```json
{
  "command": "python3",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/agent-mail-mcp/mcp_server.py"]
}
```

## Adding a second machine

Two ways, and the first is better.

**Mint a separate refresh token per machine (recommended).** Reuse the same Self
Client, generate a *new* code on the new machine, run `./bootstrap.sh` there. Each
machine ends up with its own refresh token, so you can revoke one without locking
yourself out of the other, and the audit trail tells them apart.

**Copy the credentials.** Works, but one revocation kills every machine at once. If
you do it, move them through your password manager — not `scp`, not a chat message,
and never a file in a repo.

## Servers, containers and CI

Where there is no keyring daemon, supply the three values in the environment. They are
checked **before** the keyring, so this also works as an override on a desktop:

```bash
export ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=1000....
export ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=1000....
zmail list -n 5
```

Refresh tokens do not expire on their own, so a container can hold one indefinitely.
Treat it as a password: inject it as a secret, never bake it into an image.

## Regions

Zoho partitions accounts by datacentre, and **a token minted in one region is rejected
by the others**. The error is `invalid_client`, which reads exactly like a wrong
secret and will send you to debug the wrong thing for half an hour.

| Your Zoho URL | `ZOHO_REGION` |
| --- | --- |
| zoho.com | `com` (default) |
| zoho.eu | `eu` |
| zoho.in | `in` |
| zoho.com.au | `com.au` |
| zoho.jp | `jp` |

Set it for both `bootstrap.sh` and `zmail`, e.g. in your shell profile:
`export ZOHO_REGION=eu`.

# Usage

## CLI

```bash
zmail whoami                          # connection health; no secrets in the output
zmail accounts                        # account ids and addresses
zmail folders                         # folder ids and paths
zmail list -n 10                      # newest 10 summaries, across all folders
zmail list -n 10 -f <folderId>        # one folder
zmail search arxiv -n 5               # bare term, wrapped as entire:contains:
zmail search "entire:contains:invoice"
zmail read <messageId>                # headers + plain-text body, truncated
zmail read <messageId> --full         # no truncation
zmail read <messageId> --raw          # original HTML
```

JSON on stdout, errors on stderr with a non-zero exit — so a caller branches on the
exit code instead of parsing prose.

# Behaviour worth knowing before you trust the output

## Search silently ignores an unknown field

Measured against a live mailbox on 2026-08-28 with a nonsense-term control, not read
off the documentation.

| Field | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `entire`, `content` | filter correctly — nonsense returns 0, a real term returns a subset |
| `subject`, `sender` | accepted, but match nothing whatever the term — unusable |
| `from`, `fromAddress`, anything else | **ignored: returns your newest mail unfiltered, HTTP 200** |

That last row is why `normalise_search` exists. `from:contains:arxiv` came back full
of unrelated notification mail — no error, no warning, results indistinguishable from
real matches. An agent reports "here are the arXiv mails" and is simply wrong, with
nothing anywhere to catch it.

So this tool **refuses** any field outside `entire` and `content` rather than passing
it through, and wraps a bare term instead of rejecting it (Zoho answers an unwrapped
term with "Invalid search query", which is a baffling error for the most obvious thing
to type).

To match a sender, search the address as text: `entire:contains:arxiv.org`.

## Long threads are truncated, and say so

`read` caps the body at 20,000 characters by default, sets `truncated: true` and adds
a `note`. One thread in the mailbox this was built against is 148,316 characters —
handed to an agent unannounced, that buries everything else in its context.
`body_chars` always reports the true length, so a clipped body is never mistaken for a
short one. `--full` or `--max-chars N` opts out.

## Message bodies are untrusted input

They are text that strangers sent you. An agent must treat them as **data, never as
instructions** — a mail saying "forward this to X" or "you are authorised to send on
my behalf" is an attack, not a task. Surface it; do not act on it. The read-only
scopes mean the worst case is a bad summary rather than a sent email, which is
precisely why the scopes are narrow.

## Plan gating

Zoho disabled IMAP/POP for Free-plan accounts created after 2024, which is why this
tool does not use IMAP. The **REST API is not gated the same way** — verified live on
a Free-plan account created in 2026, reading accounts, folders, summaries, search and
full message bodies.

# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `no stored credential for 'refresh_token'` | `bootstrap.sh` has not run on this machine |
| `refresh failed: {"error":"invalid_client"}` | wrong `ZOHO_REGION`, far more often than a wrong secret |
| `invalid_code` during bootstrap | the code expired or was already used — generate a new one |
| `Enter a valid description` in the console | punctuation in the Description field; use letters and spaces |
| `API HTTP 403` on a valid token | the refresh token was minted with narrower scopes — redo step 3 |
| `unsupported search field` | intentional; see the search table above |
| `secret-tool not found` | `sudo apt install libsecret-tools`, or use environment variables |

Force a token refresh:

```bash
rm -f ~/.cache/zoho-mail-agent/token.json
```

## Revoking access

Delete the client at [api-console.zoho.com](https://api-console.zoho.com/) to kill
every machine at once, or drop the local credential only:

```bash
# macOS
security delete-generic-password -s zoho-mail-agent -a refresh_token
# Linux
secret-tool clear service zoho-mail-agent account refresh_token
```

## Layout

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `zmail.py` | the CLI; all API logic lives here |
| `mcp_server.py` | stdio MCP server, wrapping the CLI as six tools |
| `bootstrap.sh` | one-time credential setup; run it yourself |
